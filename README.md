**_Task 1:_**

Feature transformation and linear regression fitting for data analysis tasks. The transform_data function converts input features into 21 new features, incorporating linear, quadratic, exponential, and cosine transformations. Meanwhile, the fit function handles the training data points, transforms them, and fits linear regression on the transformed data, outputting optimal parameters. Explore efficient data transformation and regression fitting for your analytical workflows.
